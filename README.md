# Potato-Disease-Classification-Using-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
The dataset consists of 3 classes of potato leaves.The three clasees are Healthy,Early blight and Late blight. Among these healthy leaves are the one with no disease and other two being the major diseases for potato plant. Now,we build a model which takes a leaf as an input and classifies the leaf is healthy or not.If not what kind of disease it has.
